# TCP Congestion Control Simulation using NS-2  
**Phase 1 – NS-2 Coursework Project**

This repository contains **Phase 1 of an NS-2 based TCP simulation project**, developed as part of a Computer Networks course.  
The goal of this phase is to **simulate, observe, and analyze TCP congestion control behavior** using the NS-2 network simulator.

---

## Project Overview

In this phase, TCP traffic is simulated over a predefined network topology using **NS-2 (Network Simulator 2)**.  
The project focuses on understanding how TCP reacts to congestion through metrics such as:

- Congestion Window (cwnd)
- Throughput
- Packet loss
- Queue behavior
- Time-based performance trends

All simulations are driven by **TCL scripts**, and results are extracted from **trace files** and visualized using plotting scripts.

## How to Run the Simulation

### 1. Run NS-2 Simulation

From the project root:

```bash
ns tcl/<simulation_file>.tcl
```

This generates trace files inside the `trace/` directory.

---

### 2. Process Trace Files

Run the data extraction scripts:

```bash
python scripts/<script_name>.py
```

or

```bash
awk -f scripts/<script_name>.awk trace/<trace_file>.tr
```

Processed data will be saved in the `data/` directory.

---

### 3. Generate Plots

Use plotting scripts to generate figures:

```bash
python scripts/plot_<metric>.py
```

Plots will be stored in the `plots/` directory.

---

## Output Metrics

Typical metrics analyzed in Phase 1 include:

- TCP congestion window (cwnd) vs time
- Throughput vs time
- Packet drop events
- Queue occupancy

These metrics provide insight into TCP’s congestion avoidance and recovery behavior.

---

## Design Assumptions

- Wired network topology
- DropTail queue discipline (default)
- Single or limited number of TCP flows
- No wireless or mobility effects
- NS-2 default TCP variant (unless specified in TCL)

---

## Phase 1 Scope vs Phase 2

**Phase 1** focuses on:
- Running baseline TCP simulations
- Data extraction and visualization
- Conceptual understanding of TCP congestion control

**Phase 2** (not included here) typically extends this work with:
- Different TCP variants
- Parameter tuning
- Comparative performance analysis

## Educational Value

This project provides hands-on experience with:
- NS-2 simulation workflow
- TCP congestion control mechanisms
- Trace-based network analysis
- Reproducible experiment design
